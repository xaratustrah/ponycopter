In this project we try to make a pony fly. A brushless motor is controller via a Raspberry Pi Zero. Hardware used:

- REELY 20A Sky Series ESC (1460685)
- 1800 mAh, 25C, 2S  LiPo battery
- KingKong 2205-2300KV brushless motor
- Kavan APC Propeller 7x5"
- Raspberry Pi zero + portable battery pack
- Cables
- Wood and wheels
- Pony!


The PWM pin used is the number 13, i.e. No. 33 physical pin on the Raspberry pi zero. This project assumes that you have already setup your Raspberry pi in the WIFI. You can then SSH to your Raspberry and run the program there.
